  "description": "A caching proxy server useable in your front-end projects to cache API requests and rewrite their responses as needed to be routed through server - for tradeshows, demos (offline and online), data that you know will be retired someday and you want a capture in time that you can reuse, and load testing in shared environments (exmample CloudTV where a server could be running thousands of browser sessions at once and you want to test server scalability independent of APIs an app might depend on, ala activevideo.com)",
